## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to add a background image inside a container and have it clipped inside the shape. I was able to use what I learned from an JavaScript accordion tutorial on FreeCodeCamp and put it into practice here. The layout overall was a challenge, but I learned a lot from Wayne Tasaki's solution (link below), especially with the image on the left.

### Continued development

More JavaScript, as well as CSS transitions.
